At last, a professional colorscheme for Vim...released by popular demand !

*Highlights*

* Uses light background for easy editing on bright light conditions
* Status bar and line numbers uses dark background
* No two highlighting terms have same colors making it easy to distinguish what you are looking at

Specially suited if you spend most of your day editing and writing code

Currently supports only GUI version. If there is enough demand, I will release a cterm version.
